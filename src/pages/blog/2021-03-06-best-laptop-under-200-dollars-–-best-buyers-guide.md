### Real Reviews about Dell D620 Laptop from Amazon:

I bought the D620 for my son when he’s 2 years old HP laptop died because of an overheating problem; after confirming that the Dell D620 worked properly by installing XP and connecting to the internet installed software including Norton and Office 2010 home and student version. All over the process, the D620 was done correctly. After I set up a wireless connection, I tried it by running DVDs, videos, and Office apps via the internet. This is one fine laptop, with an excellent display and very fast. Its only “weak points” are apparent from the specs, i.e., no media slots, no DVD burner, and no web camera. However, these are tiny problems due to the low price.

### Real Reviews about IBM Thinkpad T42 Laptop from Amazon:

I needed a laptop for browsing programming. I have been doing programming in my office using the T30 Thinkpad for the past 2 years. I see that IBM ThinkPad is had superior quality and stability. As my budget was low, I determined to go for a refurbished laptop; the notebook was in fair condition, I didn’t find any scratch marks on it. I am delighted with this purchase.

It comes with an excellent speed rate to it; I can open iTunes in not more than one minute, and it’s just 1min 20sec when I begin using the internet from pressing the power button (from shut off mode – full boot running XP with 1G RAM).

Mine a 2.0 GHz Pentium M Processor, a 100GB HDD, and 1.5G RAM (I upgraded from 1G a few days ago); it works excellent, and I noticed great stories about how nicely these devices run with Windows 7, and I should take time to try updating the OS on it.
